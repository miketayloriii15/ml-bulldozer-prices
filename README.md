# 🚜 Bulldozer Price Prediction with Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project builds an **end-to-end regression model** to predict the sale prices of bulldozers at auction based on historical data. It demonstrates the full **machine learning workflow**, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation.  

Inspired by the Kaggle "Blue Book for Bulldozers" competition, this project highlights how machine learning can provide actionable insights in real-world business scenarios such as **pricing, sales forecasting, and asset valuation**.
